        <h1>Crops</h1>
        <p>Crops are plants that are grown and harvested for food, livestock feed, biofuel, medicine, and other products. 
            The term is used to differentiate plants that are grown and harvested from wild plants. 
            Crops are typically grown in large quantities to produce food and other products for humans and animals. 
            They are an essential part of agriculture and are grown in fields, gardens, and greenhouses around the world.
        </p>
        <h1>Soil</h1>
        <p>Soil is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that together support life. 
            It is a natural body that exists on the earth's surface and is made up of weathered rock and mineral particles, 
            organic matter, water, air, and living organisms. Soil is essential for plant growth and provides nutrients, 
            water, and support for plants to grow. It is a vital component of the earth's ecosystem and plays a crucial role in agriculture, 
            forestry, and other human activities.
