# Agro Companion

## Overview

Agro Companion is designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts by classifying different types of soil and providing advanced crop recommendations based on various factors. Users can easily classify different types of soil such as alluvial soil, black soil, red soil, yellow soil, laterite soil, arid soil, and mountain soil. The platform also offers crop recommendations considering factors like soil type, season, rainfall, temperature, humidity, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and specific regional data, and it also provides a tool to access these information for specific crops. If climate data is not available for crop recommendation, the platform fetches the necessary information using a weather API.

### Abstract
<blockquote>
This study introduces an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for soil classification and crop recommendation, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in an ensemble approach, alongside an adaptive fuzzy logic-based decision system for crop suggestions. While existing research typically addresses soil classification or crop recommendation in isolation, this work integrates cutting-edge deep learning models and fuzzy logic to enhance both tasks. The methodology is divided into two phases: Phase 1 covers data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to expand the curated dataset of 1189 soil images to 8,413, while Phase 2 focuses on training CNN and ViT models, ensembling these models, and developing a fuzzy logic system that considers soil type, nutrients, potential of hydrogen (pH), and climatic conditions for crop recommendations. Experimental results indicate models achieve classification accuracies of up to 89.32 % on the original dataset, improving to 91.01 % with augmented data. On the CycleGAN-augmented (CyAUG) dataset, EfficientNet v2 Large and ViT-Large/16 attain accuracies of 99.60 % and 99.73 %, respectively. Furthermore, an ensemble of these architectures achieves a perfect accuracy of 100 %. The results are also validated by K-fold cross-validation. The research also presents 'Agro Companion,' an AI-powered tool that assists farmers in soil identification and crop selection based on geological and environmental data. This framework addresses key agricultural challenges in India, offering a high-accuracy, practical solution for improving both soil classification and crop recommendation. This research delivers state-of-the-art soil classification performance and a robust AI-based crop recommendation tool to support sustainable agricultural practices.

## Features

- **Soil Classification**: Identify and learn about different types of soil including alluvial, black, red, yellow, arid, and mountain soils.
- **Advanced Crop Recommendation**: Receive crop recommendations based on multiple factors such as soil type, season, climate conditions, and soil nutrients.
- **Climate Data Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data using a weather API when local climate data is unavailable.
- **Crop Information**: Detailed information on the requirements for growing specific crops, including ideal soils, season, rainfall, temperature, humidity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python-based server
- **Machine Learning**: Classification and fuzzy-logic based recommendation models
- **API Integration**: Weather API for real-time climate data
- **Application Server**: Deployed on a cloud platform Heroku

## How It Works

1. **Soil Classification**: Users can input soil data or upload an image to identify the soil type. The system processes the data/image and classifies the soil. The system uses ensembled CNN and ViT model for classification.
2. **Crop Recommendation**: Users can input various parameters such as soil type, season, and nutrient levels. The system provides crop recommendations based on these inputs. The system using fuzzy inference system for recommendation
3. **Climate Data Fetching**: If local climate data is not provided, the system uses a weather API to fetch real-time climate data relevant to the user's location.
4. **Detailed Crop Information**: Users can browse through a database of crops to view detailed growing requirements, including ideal soil type, climate conditions, and nutrient levels.
